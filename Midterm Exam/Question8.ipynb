      "======================================================================\n",
      "\n",
      "WHY COMPOSITION IS APPROPRIATE HERE:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. RELATIONSHIP TYPE:\n",
      "   - A Kennel \"has-a\" Dog (or multiple Dogs) - this is COMPOSITION\n",
      "   - A Kennel \"is-not-a\" Dog - this would be INHERITANCE\n",
      "   - Composition models \"has-a\" relationships\n",
      "   - Inheritance models \"is-a\" relationships\n",
      "\n",
      "2. WHAT INHERITANCE WOULD LOOK LIKE (WRONG APPROACH):\n",
      "\n",
      "   class Kennel(Dog):  # WRONG! A Kennel is not a type of Dog\n",
      "       def __init__(self):\n",
      "           self.dogs = []  # This doesn't make sense\n",
      "           \n",
      "   Problems with inheritance approach:\n",
      "   - A Kennel inheriting from Dog would have name, age, breed attributes\n",
      "   - These don't make sense for a Kennel (what's a kennel's breed?)\n",
      "   - The bark() method would be meaningless for a Kennel\n",
      "   - Violates Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
      "\n",
      "3. WHAT COMPOSITION LOOKS LIKE (CORRECT APPROACH):\n",
      "\n",
      "   class Kennel:\n",
      "       def __init__(self):\n",
      "           self.dogs = []  # Kennel contains Dogs\n",
      "           \n",
      "   Benefits of composition:\n",
      "   - Clear \"has-a\" relationship: Kennel has Dogs\n",
      "   - Kennel can manage multiple Dogs\n",
      "   - Kennel doesn't inherit inappropriate Dog properties/methods\n",
      "   - Flexible: can add/remove Dogs dynamically\n",
      "\n",
      "4. DESIGN PRINCIPLES:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Favor composition over inheritance\n",
      "   - Composition provides more flexibility\n",
      "   - Easier to change behavior at runtime\n",
      "   - Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies\n",
      "\n",
      "5. REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - INHERITANCE: A Labrador \"is-a\" Dog\n",
      "   - COMPOSITION: A Kennel \"has\" Dogs\n",
      "   - Trying to make Kennel inherit from Dog is like saying \n",
      "     \"A dog house is a type of dog\" - which doesn't make sense\n",
      "\n",
      "6. PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITION:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - Can easily swap Dog implementations\n",
      "   - Can manage different types of animals in the future\n",
      "   - Better separation of concerns\n",

    "WHY COMPOSITION IS APPROPRIATE HERE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. RELATIONSHIP TYPE:\n",
    "   - A Kennel \"has-a\" Dog (or multiple Dogs) - this is COMPOSITION\n",
    "   - A Kennel \"is-not-a\" Dog - this would be INHERITANCE\n",
    "   - Composition models \"has-a\" relationships\n",
    "   - Inheritance models \"is-a\" relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "2. WHAT INHERITANCE WOULD LOOK LIKE (WRONG APPROACH):\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Kennel(Dog):  # WRONG! A Kennel is not a type of Dog\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.dogs = []  # This doesn't make sense\n",
    "           \n",
    "   Problems with inheritance approach:\n",
    "   - A Kennel inheriting from Dog would have name, age, breed attributes\n",
    "   - These don't make sense for a Kennel (what's a kennel's breed?)\n",
    "   - The bark() method would be meaningless for a Kennel\n",
    "   - Violates Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "3. WHAT COMPOSITION LOOKS LIKE (CORRECT APPROACH):\n",
    "\n",
    "   class Kennel:\n",
    "       def __init__(self):\n",
    "           self.dogs = []  # Kennel contains Dogs\n",
    "           \n",
    "   Benefits of composition:\n",
    "   - Clear \"has-a\" relationship: Kennel has Dogs\n",
    "   - Kennel can manage multiple Dogs\n",
    "   - Kennel doesn't inherit inappropriate Dog properties/methods\n",
    "   - Flexible: can add/remove Dogs dynamically\n",
    "\n",
    "4. DESIGN PRINCIPLES:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Favor composition over inheritance\n",
    "   - Composition provides more flexibility\n",
    "   - Easier to change behavior at runtime\n",
    "   - Avoids deep inheritance hierarchies\n",
    "\n",
    "5. REAL-WORLD ANALOGY:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - INHERITANCE: A Labrador \"is-a\" Dog\n",
    "   - COMPOSITION: A Kennel \"has\" Dogs\n",
    "   - Trying to make Kennel inherit from Dog is like saying \n",
    "     \"A dog house is a type of dog\" - which doesn't make sense\n",
    "\n",
    "6. PRACTICAL ADVANTAGES OF COMPOSITION:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Can easily swap Dog implementations\n",
    "   - Can manage different types of animals in the future\n",
    "   - Better separation of concerns\n",
    "   - Kennel focuses on management, Dog focuses on dog properties\n",

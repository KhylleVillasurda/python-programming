    "FLOATING-POINT REPRESENTATION ERROR:\n",

    "1. What it is: Floating-point numbers in computers use binary (base-2) representation,\n",
    "   but many decimal (base-10) fractions cannot be represented exactly in binary.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Why it occurs: Similar to how 1/3 = 0.333... cannot be represented exactly in decimal,\n",
    "   numbers like 0.1 cannot be represented exactly in binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examples:\n",
    "   - 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 in floating-point\n",
    "   - This is because 0.1 in binary is a repeating fraction: 0.0001100110011...\n",
    "\n",
    "HOW FORMATTING MITIGATES DISPLAY ISSUES:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Rounding before display: By rounding to a fixed number of decimal places (2 for currency),\n",
    "   we hide the microscopic representation errors that are irrelevant for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. String formatting: The f-string formatting :.2f truncates the display to 2 decimal places,\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "WHY BANKER'S ROUNDING IS PREFERRED:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Unbiased: Ties-to-even rounding is statistically unbiased - it doesn't consistently\n",
    "   round up or down for halfway cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Financial fairness: In large datasets, traditional \"round half up\" can introduce\n",
    "   systematic bias that favors one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. IEEE 754 standard: Banker's rounding is the default in IEEE 754 and many programming\n",
    "   languages including Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Example of bias: With round-half-up, numbers 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 all round up,\n",
    "   creating upward bias. With banker's rounding: 0.5â†’0, 1.5â†’2, 2.5â†’2, 3.5â†’4, 4.5â†’4 - balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT CORRECTION:\n",
    "In the test cases above, I made an error: 3.5 should round to 4 (not 3.50) when rounding\n",

    "   - Without a fixed seed, random simulations produce different results each run\n",
    "   - This makes debugging and result verification difficult\n",
    "   - Fixed seeds ensure reproducible research and testing\n",
    "\n",

    "   - 100,000 rolls gives ~0.3% relative error typically\n",

    "BENEFITS OF INHERITANCE:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CODE REUSE:\n",
    "   - Car and Truck inherit ALL functionality from Vehicle\n",
    "   - No need to rewrite drive(), refuel(), __init__ for each subclass\n",
    "   - Common changes only need to be made in Vehicle base class\n",
    "\n",
    "2. CONSISTENT INTERFACE:\n",
    "   - All vehicles have the same basic methods\n",
    "   - Easy to work with different vehicle types polymorphically\n",
    "\n",
    "3. EXTENSIBILITY:\n",
    "   - Can add vehicle-specific features in subclasses\n",
    "   - Truck overrides drive() for different efficiency\n",
    "   - Car adds num_doors attribute\n",
    "   - Truck adds cargo_capacity attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MAINTAINABILITY:\n",
    "   - Bug fixes in Vehicle automatically apply to all subclasses\n",
    "   - New features can be added to base class for all vehicles\n",
